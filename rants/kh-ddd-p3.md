Against my better judgement I'm going to try and summarize my progress in Dream Drop Distance.
Uh...
Oh, god.
Uuuhhh...

You go to Tron world and awkwardly reenact the movie, I think, I haven't actually seen Legacy, but I felt more lost than usual with regards to the plot for KH worlds where I haven't seen the source material. Like, Sora's stay in the world feels incredibly strange. We're told that Tron is being mind-controlled by some guy named CLU, who I think is a (younger) digital recreation of Jeff Bridges who is the guy who made The Grid. Sora beats up Tron (called Rinzler for, uh, reasons) and he falls through a floor, CLU flies off to pick him up and Sora just... kind of leaves and we never see Rinzler again.
Oh yeah, right before the boss fight Sora has another run in with the mysterious stranger who looks like a younger Xehanort (because he is) who says something cryptic about dreams I don't quite remember.

Afterwards is Pinnochio's world where things get real weird because we meet Jiminy Cricket, but not the real one, because the real one is outside of the sleeping world, but because the world is a dream it simply makes up the pople that are missing or something like that??
I dunno, we end up going into the ocean where we see Monstro the whale swallow Jiminy and Pinnochio, then a giant crab monster freezes Monstro and whe have a fight against it on the iceberg that creates. Then at the end we punch Monstro out of the ice and encase him in a bubble which we then roll over the boss, who Monstro then proceeds to swallow the crab monster. After all of this Sora just kind of goes "Oh, so I guess that's what happened to this world before it got lost to Darkness back during my first adventure" and then leaves.

On Riku's side of the story we go inside Monstro and basically reenact the events of KH1's visit to this world except this time instead of Riku being the one to kidnap Pinnochio away from Gepetto it's Riku.
Uhm... yeah, I don't really get it either, I guess the Organization had another replica of him lying around or something??
Afterwards we get the option to read a summary of Chain of Memories, so I assume it has to be related to that somehow.

Now we need to revisit Traverse Town to help the cast of The World Ends with You out with a mission where they have to defeat a Dream Eater who's switching between the two versions of the world, so Sora and Riku cooporate to do that. The Dream Eater escapes in the end so we leave the world. At this point the game begins to explore what's actually going on with the two worlds thing, or rather it has Riku ponder about it with Joshua because Sora is just kind of going along with it.
It's stated that what's going on is definitely not time shennanigans but more like the worlds are being dreamt up by two seperate dreamers.
I really don't know where this leaves the canonicity of anything that happens in the Disney worlds for this game, especially with the one coming up.

The next world is set in the The Three Musketeers movie with Mickey, Donald and Goofy. This world seems to be happening at some point in the past, but I don't know if Mickey is a king at this point or not. He does say that this isn't his home world, so presumably this is some time after or during his time as Yen Sid's apprentice, since he recognizes Sora's Keyblade.
Are Donald and Goofy from this world or not? Did Mickey meet them here and they agreed to go with him to Disney castle? Minnie Mouse is a princess in this world, is this where she was originally from? Why is Mickey here to begin with?
Also Pete is here and he's missing a leg. I know that's how he looks in the movie this is based on, but is this a different Pete or the same one we met in KH2? Did he grow his leg back?? Is this world canon at all or just a fever dream??

Ugh, let's just move on to the Fantasia world. Uhm, they definitely had an idea for what they wanted to do with this world but I don't think it really worked out. The classical music from the movie is playing as you go through the world and isn't intereupted by enemies appearing, Sora and Riku also don't make combat grunts while fighting in this world and every time you hit something it makes really cheesy musical... noises. Like, obviously they wanted the music to be in focus here, but it just ends up feeling super awkward and stilted.
Sora ends up finding the Dream Eater that escaped from Traverse Town and defeats it, meanwhile Riku meets up with twinky Xehanort again. Looks like he was trying to get Riku to give into the darkness and recruit him but concludes that Riku has managed to definitvely shield his heart from it or something, so instead just sends Chernabog after him.
After this it's time to go to the final world and it's The World that Never Was from KH2.

I think I'm going to have to break off the update here because it's running a little long and this is the point where I had to pause the game after almost every sentence of dialogue.
