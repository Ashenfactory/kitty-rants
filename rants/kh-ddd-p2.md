Back on Dream Drop Distance, finishing up the Hunchback of Notre Dame world and I have to say the boss theme for this world does not fit, like, at all. 
You're fighting a nightmare gargoyle that shoots its arms at you and shoots fire. The track also plays when it's chasing Riku across a bridge and you're running towards shelter, breaking carts and barrels on your way. It sounds way more like happy bouncy fun times.

So, the Disney worlds in Kingdom Hearts often end up feeling a little sparsely populated because we only ever really see the bare minimum of NPCs we need in each world to tell the story.
It's not a huge revelation, but I think I've figured out why. Because they're committing to somewhat replicate the look of each world, that means they can't have generic filler NPCs.

Sora learns that Frollo is telling Quasimodo that he should stay in the cathedral forever. Then Sora beats Frollo's nightmare gargoyle. Frollo unrelatedly dies from slipping off the cathedral. Quasimodo gets Phoebos and Esmerelda to hold hands. Then Sora finds Quasimodo about to leave the cathedral and tells him that he can't let his heart be a prison. Quasimodo says he knows that, and that he was really the one keeping himself from leaving and then peaces out.
Then Xehanort shows up and calls Sora hypocrite. Sora says "wat". Xehanort says "Even if you aren't the prisoner" while a vision of Vanitas shows up next to him. Then he leaves and Sora wonders "Is my heart a prison?"
Then the player is presented with the option to read a summary of Birth By Sleep with the express purpose of saying "Ventus's heart is inside of Sora's" 
If they'd left out the Vanitas ghost and the summary I'd actually call it a pretty neat exchange.

a> I posted the following update later the same day.

More DDD shenannigans. Just finished the Hunchback world with Riku.
I don't know if I explained how this game flows, so let me at least reiterate: You swap between playing Sora and Riku, each of whom are in a parallel version of the worlds they visit. So you play every world twice and the story plays out slightly differently, but not meaningfully so as far as I've seen so far. Like, in Sora's version of Hunchback the climax played out kind of like in the movie. In Riku's version Frollo just kind of goes full crazy and lets himself fall over backwards off the cathedral while talking about judgement.

Suddenly Ansem (not really Ansem, but Xehanort's Heartless) shows up to talk a bit of trash and then leaves. Afterwards we get the option to read a summary of KH1 in case we don't know who the hell that guy is.
Once both sides of the world is completed you get an extra epilogue thing. This time it's Axel from KH2 waking up back in the lab where he originally became a Nobody along with the rest of the Organization XIII members.

I guess we just happened to defeat their Heartless at some point??
Afterwards we get the option to read a summary of 358/2 Days ðŸ˜…
