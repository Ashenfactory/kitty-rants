I'm going to try and summarize the last chapter of Kingdom Hearts Re:Coded that I left off.
First of all I need to emphasize that the first half of the game is revisiting KH1 worlds. Then when we need to debug Data-Riku we do this by revisiting all of those worlds again except this time it's with a greyscale filter. The last chapter takes place after the journal data has been rebooted and everything has been set back to normal and Data-Sora has forgotten his whole little adventure.

Now Mickey and the gang can finally actually investigate the data they were trying to get to all along. Mickey goes into the journal again to convince an amnesiac Data-Sora that they're friends and Sora of course goes along with it. Mickey sends Sora ahead and he ends up in... Castle Oblivion!
What follows is kind of a retelling of the game that is itself kind of a retelling of the first game, culminating in us revisiting the same worlds for the third time.
Except this time 'round it's just awkward silent dialogues with the characters broken up by dialogue with a mysterious hooded figure!
Eventually this hooded figure is revealed to be none other than Data-Roxas and he's really really hung up about bad things hurting and feeling sad, which is why he challenges Sora to a duel. Once beaten he fuses with him and Sora heads off to the final room where he finds Data-NaimÃ©!

Here we finally learn what all this is about. Turns out that NaminÃ© discovered a bunch of memories in Sora's heart that don't belong to him and she... uhm, put them into the journal instead somehow. This is also what caused the data to unintentionally become corrupted. Basically we've got left over bits of Xion and Ventus hanging around in Sora and... uh, I guess it's really important that we make them stop being sad.
Also this was kind of a trial run to see if the real Sora would be emotionally strong enough to deal with this... and I guess Data-Sora passed the test?
Anyway the real takeway from all of this is that (Data-)Sora finally thanks (Data-)NaminÃ©!

In the post credits sequence we see a meeting between Mickey and Yen Sid where we learn that when you destroy someone's Heartless and Nobody the original person is restored. This means that Master Xehanort is going to return and Yen Sid also goes on to warn that there are more than one of him!
I kind of knew about this already, but seeing the reveal hits different ðŸ˜…

Fucking time travel.
The one complication we hadn't touched yet.

In other news partner and I managed to beat Goblet of Fire and the final three levels of the incredibly co-op focused game are entirely single player. The game makes literally no effort to present the story, simply plopping things down and hoping that you'll remember the movie. The cutscenes are some of the lowest effort I've seen and the finale of the game is an insulting, underwhelming and prolonged wet fart ðŸ˜…
