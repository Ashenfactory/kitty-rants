Quick little Kingdom Hearts update:
Following Dream Drop Distance I got into the next entry in the series, *Kingdom Hearts 0.2 Birth by Sleep -A fragmentary passage-*. It's a short little prequel type thing set after Birth By Sleep's Final Episode, roughly 2-3 hours of gameplay, more if you're going for 100%. It's also a bit of a teaser of KH3 and serves as something of a tech demo, showing off the switch to Unreal Engine.

Following DDD this felt like a very welcome return to form with a fresh coat of paint and some pretty cool visuals here and there.
Storywise it's "just" following Aqua's further adventures through the Realm of Darkness where she revisits some of the worlds she saw during BBS after they've been consumed by darkness as a result of the KH1's Heartless invasion. She meets up with Mickey by the end and helps out behind the scenes with KH1's ending. Oh and I guess it explains why Mickey doesn't wear a shirt during his appearance in 1. What a strange detail to focus on ðŸ˜…

The game ends with a cutscene to get us hyped for KH3 as Sora sets out to regain his lost abilities.
Oh, and there's a really tricky secret boss fight against a phantom version of Aqua that felt super rewarding to learn and beat ðŸ˜Š
