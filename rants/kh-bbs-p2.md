Little Kingdom Hearts update!
I got started on Ventus's story and starting back at level 1 I can definitely tell I've gotten more familiar with the mechanics of the game. I'm switching up my Commands more often to level them up, same for D-Links and generally taking out enemies quicker than during my first playthrough.
Somehow the worlds so far in Ven's story have felt more... meandering than Terra. Like, it feels like we're spending way more time playing out the Disney stories than in Terra's story, but maybe it's just because I've been to the worlds before?
Anyway, revisiting the worlds reminded me of a few things I had meant to mention in the previous update so I'll get around that now:
I think part of what's bothering me about the Unversed is that they don't really seem to represent what they're supposed to be about. Like, we're told they're born of negative emotions, and I'd expect to see that reflected in their design somehow. I guess some of them have sad faces, I dunno...
The very first boss you fight in Terra's story is in the Sleeping Beauty world and it's a GIANT EVIL SPINNING WHEEL! (As in the tool Aurora pricked her finger on)
Another thing that made me lose my mind was in Radiant Gardens. Quick aside: The game does actually aknowledge that Scrooge comes from another world when Ven meets him, apparently he asked Merlin to take him there for... business reasons? Anyway, aside from *358/2 Days* all the games so far have had 100 Acre Woods as a world you can visit by entering the magic Winnie the Pooh book. That book is also in this game and each of the three character's playtrhoughs have a handful of cutscenes dedicated to meeting Merlin and the book and they talk about how it "unlocks one's hidden powers" but all it really does is UNLOCK A NEW BOARD (shaped like a honey pot) FOR THE BOARD GAME. This has to be cut content right? 100 Acre Wood was planned but they had to cut it for time but kept all the cutscenes for it?

Another example of the Unversed not really seeming to represent what they ought to: The boss for Terra's part of the Cinderella world happens at the ball. When the step-mother and her daughters see Cinderella dancing they get really envious and that summons a giant conductor demon thing that uses a baton to levitate musical instrument at you.
I get that a ball is musically themed but nothing about the boss communicates envy, jealousy or anything like that.
Again, if these were just Heartless I wouldn't think anything of it, but since the game seems to think these are different somehow I keep thinking about it 😆
I guess I have a habit of skipping over the positives because it's more fun to talk about the confusing and funny bits, so I'll take a moment to say that I enjoyed storming Maleficent's castle and fighting her little goblin minions and her boss fight was a nice balanced challenge 👍
Oh, and Ventus's boss fight in Snow White's world is a big scary tree which does fit as something being born from Snow White's fear as she ran through the forest.

Uh-oh, I just remembered something else that I couldn't stop overthinking.
In the Cinderella world Ventus is shrunken down to mouse size for no discernable reason. This didn't happen to Terra and I don't think it'll happen to Aqua. I can understand that it was the easiest way to make Cinderlla's house a location with meaningful gameplay (interacting with the mice (even though they cut all but one mouse for the game, even the birds are gone), making the dress, fighting the cat), but this seems really weirdly implemented, Ventus just goes "Whaaa, why am I this smaaaaall?!" and we just keep going.
In the other games Sora and company would look different in some worlds to fit in more easily, but that was explained as something Donald did with his magic, here's it's just some bizarre happenstance. But the situation did result in a mouse saying "Ventus, look out for Lucifer", so I guess I can forgive it.
(okay, done for now, I promise)

a> I wasn't done. Instead I went on a tangent about a few of the tings that feel inconsistent between the metaphysics of the game world and the game design itself.

They'll say that it's important to keep undercover and keep travel between worlds a secret early on but it just kind of fades into the background immediately after being mentioned.
My thinking is that they needed an excuse for temporary party members to stay in their own worlds in the first game.
In the first game Beast actually gives a reason as to why he doesn't come with you, even though he's already in a different world. His concern is looking after Belle.

Part of KH2's climax has a scientist saying that his life of research into the workings of the heart have really brought him no closer to actually understanding it and that it's probably unknowable.
But it feels like the games still really want to explain these things anyway 😅

Honestly I would probably end up nitpicking it no matter how they went about it. Kingdom Hearts is messy by its very nature. It's operating on a high-octane blend of fairy-tale logic and JRPG logic.

My impression of Nomura's world-building is that it's fairly systematised, like I remember seeing some notes of his about how many layers there are to the world or something, like, depending on how close they were to either the realm of Light or Dark. And there's stuff about the constituent elements of a person being a Body, a Heart and a Soul (also seemingly the Mind is separate too in some cases, going by what happens by the end of Terra's story).
But these systems are still built on a foundation of pathos, so any rule that comes up is always liable to being overruled by the power of friendship or similar.

So if I go crazy at times it's because it feels like the games are, in a sense, taking a very long time to say that none of this matters because the heart is unpredictable.

The only way Kingdom Hearts makes sense is if you embrace the big mushy feelings.
