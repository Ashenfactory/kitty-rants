Well, I've played one hour of Dream Drop Distance and, uh... oh boy, it's a lot ðŸ˜†
One of the first things I noticed was that the Command Deck from Birth By Sleep is back, and I thought "Oh, okay, so I won't get overwhelmed by new systems, it'll just be that again", but then the *new* stuff starts creeping in and I find out that Kingdom Hearts has its own PokÃ©mon now??
Like... I'd heard the name Dream Eater before and I knew there was a new enemy type but not anything like this ðŸ˜…
And five minutes after getting to Traverse Town you hang out with the protagonist from The World Ends With You??
And there's... this mechanic called Dropping where you switch between Sora and Riku who are seemingly in mirror versions of the same world??
And it's on some kind of timer?
I thought I was ready ðŸ¤£

Oh yeah the game has combat parkour called Flowmotion.

I think... I think the ending of Traverse Town only makes sense if you've played The World Ends With You??
Is Joshua god? Why did they start the game like this??? ðŸ¤£

Ended my session after a bit of time in Hunchback of Notre Dame, things seem back to regularly scheduled Disney filler for the time being, except this time 'round we're doing every world twice in tandem.
